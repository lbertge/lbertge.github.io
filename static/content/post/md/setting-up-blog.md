# Hello

I set up this blog to help write down and consolidate my thoughts, which are often all over the place. 

I wrote this blog mostly from scratch. I used VueJS to chunk the code into different components. I'm writing each post's content in YAML+Markdown.

$$ x + y^s \int_{1}^{2}$$

$x+y$

`$$ x + y $$`

Table

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

<!-- The following is the same table, which is just already-rendered HTML (converted from this table above). The difference is that the table is wrapped in a div, which has overflow-x styling to make it more accessible for mobile. It's a hacky fix. -->
